# ADR-0001: PrintPressAdvisor ⊣ Special-Purpose Machinery Plant Operations Governor architecture

## Status

Accepted. `cloud-itonami-isic-2829` promoted from `:spec` to
`:implemented` in the `kotoba-lang/industry` registry, following the
verified fresh-scaffold protocol established by prior actors in this
fleet.

## Context

`cloud-itonami-isic-2829` publishes an OSS blueprint for ISIC 2829
(Manufacture of other special-purpose machinery) -- the RESIDUAL n.e.c.
special-purpose-machinery category (e.g. printing machinery, plastics/
rubber-working machinery, mining/construction-adjacent specialty
machines), distinct from siblings 2812 (fluid power equipment), 2815
(ovens, furnaces and furnace burners), 2819 (other general-purpose
machinery), and 2823 (machinery for metallurgy). Rather than model the
whole heterogeneous n.e.c. bucket, this build picks ONE concrete
illustrative product line, documented plainly in the README:
industrial printing-press manufacturing (offset presses, flexographic
presses, gravure presses, digital-inkjet presses, screen-printing
presses, die-cutting presses) -- **plant operations coordination**
(production-batch product-type/registration-accuracy/quantity/defect-
rate data logging, fabrication/assembly-commissioning-bench-equipment
maintenance scheduling, safety-concern flagging, and outbound product
shipment coordination). Like every actor in this fleet, the blueprint
alone is not an implementation: this ADR records the governed-actor
architecture that promotes it to real, tested code, following the same
langgraph StateGraph + independent Governor + Phase 0->3 rollout
pattern established across the cloud-itonami fleet.

The closest domain analog is `cloud-itonami-isic-2823` (Manufacture of
machinery for metallurgy): both are back-office coordination actors
for a fixed manufacturing plant with QC-tested, discrete-unit
finished-goods output and a real physical/consumer safety dimension,
sharing the same four-op shape (`:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-
maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment`), the same
two-entity verified/registered gate structure (equipment for
maintenance scheduling, batch for shipment coordination), and the same
permanent equipment-actuation and certification-authority blocks. This
build mirrors `cloud-itonami-isic-2823`'s architecture closely but
adapts the hazard profile, equipment vocabulary, and product taxonomy
to the printing-press plant: its finished goods are fabricated and
assembly/commissioning-bench-tested printing-press machines (offset
presses, flexographic presses, gravure presses, digital-inkjet
presses, screen-printing presses, die-cutting presses) rather than
metallurgy-processing machines, so its equipment kinds are
`:fabrication-line` and `:press-commissioning-bench` rather than
2823's fabrication-line/assembly-test-bench, and its routine QC field
is `:registration-accuracy-mm` (color-registration misalignment
measured in millimetres during fabrication/assembly-commissioning-
bench proof-run testing, plausibility-checked 0-5mm -- production-
quality color registration is typically held well under 0.1mm, and
even a badly out-of-tolerance press being flagged for rework rarely
reports misalignment beyond a few millimetres, so this ceiling
generously bounds well above any real routine proof-run reading)
rather than 2823's `:load-test-tonnes`. Like 2823, shipment quantity
is tracked in finished-unit UNITS (`:units`/`:quantity-units`/
`:shipped-units`), since printing-press machinery is likewise discrete
counted units rather than a bulk weight.

This vertical shares 2823's structural DOMAIN-SPECIFIC permanent
block, adapted to the machinery-safety certification regime relevant
to printing-press equipment: printing presses are subject to
machinery-safety conformity regimes (e.g. EU Machinery Directive
2006/42/EC CE marking, ANSI B65.1 Safety Standard for Printing Press
Systems). This actor is never the certification authority -- any
proposal (regardless of op) that declares `:issue-certification?
true` is a HARD, PERMANENT, unconditional block
(`printpressmfg.governor/certification-authority-blocked-violations`),
the same "no phase, no human override" posture as the equipment-
actuation block.

This vertical has NO pre-existing `kotoba-lang/printpressmfg`-style
capability library to wrap (verified: no such repo exists). This build
therefore uses self-contained domain logic -- pure functions in
`printpressmfg.registry` (equipment/batch verification, shipment-
quantity recompute, product-type validation, registration-accuracy
plausibility validation, defect-rate plausibility validation) are
re-verified independently by the governor, the same "ground truth, not
self-report" discipline established across prior actors (most
directly `cloud-itonami-isic-2823`'s `metalmachmfg.registry`).

This blueprint's own `:itonami.blueprint/governor` keyword,
`:special-purpose-machinery-plant-operations-governor`, is grep-verified
UNIQUE fleet-wide (`gh search code
"special-purpose-machinery-plant-operations-governor" --owner
cloud-itonami`, zero hits before this repo was created). The
`printpressmfg` namespace is likewise grep-verified UNIQUE fleet-wide
(`gh search code "printpressmfg" --owner cloud-itonami`, zero hits
before this repo was created).

## Decision

### Decision 1: Self-contained domain logic (no external printing-press-manufacturing capability library to wrap)

Unlike actors that delegate to pre-existing domain libraries, this
special-purpose-machinery vertical has NO pre-existing capability
library to wrap. The equipment/batch-verification / shipment-quantity
/ product-type / registration-accuracy / defect-rate validation
functions live as pure functions in `printpressmfg.registry` and are
re-verified independently by `printpressmfg.governor` -- the same
"ground truth, not self-report" discipline established across prior
actors (most directly `cloud-itonami-isic-2823`'s
`metalmachmfg.registry`).

### Decision 2: Coordination, not control — scope boundary at the back-office

This actor is **strictly back-office coordination** of special-
purpose-machinery plant operations. It does NOT:
- Control fabrication or assembly-commissioning-bench-line equipment directly
- Make plant-safety or certification decisions (exclusive to the human plant supervisor / accredited certification body)
- Actuate fabrication/assembly-line equipment
- Self-issue a CE (EU Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC) or ANSI B65.1 (Safety Standard for Printing Press Systems) machinery-safety conformity mark

All proposals are `:effect :propose` only. The advisor proposes; the
governor validates; escalation paths funnel to human plant-supervisor
approval. This is not a replacement for the supervisor's authority or
the certification body's authority — it is a proposal-screening and
documentation layer.

**CRITICAL SAFETY BOUNDARY**: printing-press manufacturing involves
real nip-point/pinch/crush hazards at impression cylinders, feeder/
delivery sections and web-transport paths during fabrication,
assembly, and proof-run commissioning, with quality-defect
consequences downstream in whatever print shop the batch's machinery
ends up installed in. Safety-concern flagging NEVER auto-commits. All
safety concerns escalate immediately to human review.

### Decision 3: Safety-concern escalation — always human sign-off

`:flag-safety-concern` (equipment-safety/quality-defect concern)
ALWAYS escalates, never auto-commits. This is not a "low-stakes
proposal" -- it is a circuit-breaker that must reach human authority.

### Decision 4: Two independent verified/registered gates (equipment AND batch), not one

Like `cloud-itonami-isic-2823`, this vertical has TWO entity kinds
each gating a different op: `:schedule-maintenance` independently
verifies the referenced **equipment** unit's own `:verified?`/
`:registered?` fields; `:coordinate-shipment` independently verifies
the referenced **batch**'s own `:verified?`/`:registered?` fields.
Both are the same "plant/batch record must be independently verified/
registered before any action" HARD invariant applied to the two
distinct record kinds this domain actually has. `:coordinate-shipment`
additionally independently recomputes whether a batch's own recorded
shipped-to-date unit quantity plus the proposal's own claimed unit
quantity would exceed the batch's own recorded production quantity --
never taken on the advisor's self-report.

### Decision 5: HARD invariants (no override)

Four HARD governor invariants (elaborated into twelve concrete checks
in `printpressmfg.governor`, mirroring `cloud-itonami-isic-2823`'s own
elaboration of its HARD invariants into concrete checks) block
proposals and cannot be overridden by human approval:
1. Plant/batch record (equipment for maintenance, batch for shipment) must be independently verified/registered before any action is taken against it, and a shipment's quantity must independently recompute within the batch's own logged production quantity
2. Proposals must be `:effect :propose` only (never direct equipment control)
3. Direct fabrication/assembly-line-equipment control, equipment actuation, or self-issued machinery-safety certification is permanently blocked
4. The op allowlist is closed — `:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` only

## Consequences

(+) Special-purpose-machinery plant operations back-office now has a
documented, governed, auditable coordination layer that funnels all
decisions through independent validation before human approval.

(+) The "coordination, not control" boundary is explicit in code: all
`:effect :propose`, all real-world actuation requires human plant-
supervisor sign-off, and no machinery-safety certification mark can
ever be self-issued.

(+) Scope is bounded and verifiable: four HARD invariants (elaborated
into twelve concrete governor checks) protect against scope creep into
unauthorized equipment operation, equipment actuation, or
certification self-issuance. Safety concerns are a circuit-breaker,
not a threshold.

(+) Safety-critical discipline is explicit: safety-concern flagging
cannot be rate-limited, suppressed, or auto-decided by phase gate.
Human review is mandatory.

(-) Still a simulation/proposal layer, not a real plant-operations
control system. Equipment actuation, line operation, and certification
issuance remain human-/institution-controlled via external channels.

(-) No integration with real plant-management databases (equipment
telemetry, batch tracking, freight dispatch, certification-body APIs)
— this is a standalone coordinator blueprint.

## Verification

- `cloud-itonami-isic-2829`: `clojure -M:test` green (all tests pass;
  see the superproject ADR and `kotoba-lang/industry` registry entry
  for the exact `Ran N tests containing M assertions, 0 failures, 0
  errors` output, verified from an independent fresh clone), `clojure
  -M:lint` clean, `clojure -M:dev:run` demo narrative exercises
  proposal submission, escalation, and every HARD-hold scenario
  directly (not-propose-effect, unknown-op, equipment-not-verified,
  batch-not-verified, shipment-quantity-exceeded, equipment-actuate-
  blocked, certification-authority-blocked, already-scheduled,
  invalid-product-type, invalid-registration-accuracy, invalid-
  defect-rate).
- All source is `.cljc` (portable ClojureScript / JVM / nbb) — no
  JVM-only interop; the actor graph is invoked exclusively via
  `langgraph.graph/run*` (not `.invoke`, which is not cljs-portable).
- Audit ledger is append-only, all decisions are traced; every settled
  request (commit or hold) leaves exactly one ledger fact.
- `deps.edn` pins `io.github.kotoba-lang/langgraph` and
  `io.github.kotoba-lang/langchain` via `:local/root` directly in the
  top-level `:deps` (not only under a `:dev` alias), so a bare
  `clojure -M:test` resolves offline inside the monorepo checkout.
